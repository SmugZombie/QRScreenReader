# QRScreenReader

QRScreenReader is a simple tool that allows you to scan QR codes displayed on your monitor with the computer they are being displayed on. This allows for scanning QR codes that may not have direct links associated with them or from places you normally wouldn't be able to copy and paste from (Teams/Discord/Slack Meetings)

Example:

Tapping F1 on your keyboard initiates a scan of the viewable screen area and check for QR Codes

Installation:
* Clone this repo
* If you already have AutoHotKey installed you should be able to use the .ahk in place or move it to somehwere you would like it as long as the base stucture stays the same.
* If you don't already have AutoHotKey and don't wish to tinker you can download the latest EXE in the releases section and replace the .ahk file with that file instead as it is already compiled.

Once installed:
* Just hit F1 when you see a qr code you wish to scan.

Future:
* Handling by QR Type - If a link, automatically opens in a new window
* Logging so you can see previous qr codes
* QR Code detection on screenshot / image in clipboard
* Something neater than AHK (as neat as it is)
* Installer
