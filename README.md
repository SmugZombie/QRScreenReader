# QRScreenReader

QRScreenReader is a simple tool that allows you to scan QR codes displayed on your monitor with the computer they are being displayed on. This allows for scanning QR codes that may not have direct links associated with them or from places you normally wouldn't be able to copy and paste from (Teams/Discord/Slack Meetings)

Example:

Tapping F1 on your keyboard initiates a scan of the viewable screen area and check for QR Codes

Future:
* Handling by QR Type - If a link, automatically opens in a new window
* Logging so you can see previous qr codes
* QR Code detection on screenshot / image in clipboard
* Something neater than AHK (as neat as it is)
